## Installation

This project leverages [mapyde](https://github.com/scipp-atlas/mapyde) for event generation. To set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies, follow the steps below.

1. Create a New Conda Environment

Open your terminal and create a new conda environment (replace `<env_name>` with your preferred environment name). For example, to create an environment with Python 3.9, run:

```bash
conda create --name h2zllahad python=3.9
```

Activate the environment with:

```bash
conda activate h2zllahad
```

2. Install Dependencies
Install the required dependencies listed in the setup script:

```bash
source setup.sh
```
